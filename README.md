**1.What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.** <br>
We want to predict which countries and regions will struggle with electricity access in the next few years. <br>
We'll use information about their economy, population, and current infrastructure to identify patterns. <br>
The goal is to create a system that tells aid organizations and governments: "These are the places that need help most urgently" and "Here's what factors make the biggest difference." <br>

**2.How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?** <br>
**Current Approach:** <br>
Organizations track energy access through annual surveys <br>
Decisions are often reactive - helping after problems become severe <br>
Analysis is mostly descriptive (showing what happened) not predictive (forecasting what will happen) <br>
Different organizations use different data, making it hard to compare <br>
**Limits:** <br>
By the time data is collected and reported, it's already 1-2 years old <br>
No systematic way to predict which countries need help next <br>
Limited understanding of which factors matter most <br>
Resource allocation is often based on political factors rather than data-driven need <br>
