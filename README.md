**1.What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.**
We want to predict which countries and regions will struggle with electricity access in the next few years. 
We'll use information about their economy, population, and current infrastructure to identify patterns. 
The goal is to create a system that tells aid organizations and governments: "These are the places that need help most urgently" and "Here's what factors make the biggest difference."

**2.How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
**Current Approach:**
Organizations track energy access through annual surveys
Decisions are often reactive - helping after problems become severe
Analysis is mostly descriptive (showing what happened) not predictive (forecasting what will happen)
Different organizations use different data, making it hard to compare
**Limits:**
By the time data is collected and reported, it's already 1-2 years old
No systematic way to predict which countries need help next
Limited understanding of which factors matter most
Resource allocation is often based on political factors rather than data-driven need
