Milestone 1 - Data Acquisition

Date: 5 Feb 2026
- Began the data acquisition phase for the Energy Poverty Prediction project.
- Identified World Bank — World Development Indicators (WDI) as the primary data source for all relevant variables.
  Link: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator
- Selected variables based on their relevance to electricity access prediction, including economic indicators (GDP per capita), population metrics (urban/rural %, total population, density), energy indicators (renewable energy %), and governance (government effectiveness index).
- Decided on country-year as the unit of analysis (1990–2023) to ensure temporal consistency across countries.
- Considered data types and subtypes for each variable to guide later preprocessing:
  * STRING → Qualitative, Nominal/Ordinal (e.g., country, risk_category)
  * INT → Quantitative, Interval/Ratio (e.g., year, total_population)
  * FLOAT → Quantitative, Ratio/Interval (e.g., electricity_access, gdp_per_capita)
- Manually downloaded all raw CSV files from the World Bank WDI portal.

Date: 9 Feb 2026
- Completed organization of raw data under data/raw/ for reproducibility.
- Ensured all datasets reflect the original values without preprocessing.
- Prepared a data dictionary to document each variable, measurements, source, and description.
- Created preliminary plans for derived variables to be generated during preprocessing:
  * risk_category — Energy poverty classification
  * prediction_year — Forecast year
  * predicted_electricity_access — Model outputs (post-modeling)
- Confirmed that no proprietary or restricted data sources were used; all data is publicly available.
- The datasets are now ready for the preprocessing and modeling workflow, ensuring that analysis will be reproducible and transparent.
